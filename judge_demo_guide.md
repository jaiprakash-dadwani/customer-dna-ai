## üöÄ **DEMO EXECUTION PLAN** (8 minutes)

### **OPENING HOOK** (30 seconds)
*"Judges, you're looking at a live system monitoring 150+ customers in real-time. Every number you see is updating, every alert is triggering interventions, every pattern is being analyzed by AI. This is Customer DNA AI at full scale."*

### **PART 1: Live System Overview** (2 minutes)

**[Show the real-time metrics dashboard]**
- Point to live customer count: "150+ customers monitored simultaneously"
- Highlight critical alerts: "12 customers need immediate intervention"
- Show success rate: "78% intervention acceptance - updating in real-time"

**[Show the notification feed]**
*"Watch these notifications - they're happening live:"*
- Point to RG alerts: "Loss chasing detected"
- Point to Fraud alerts: "Unusual payment patterns"
- Point to Service alerts: "Customer frustration identified"
- Point to Marketing blocks: "Vulnerable customers protected"

**Key Message**: *"This isn't a simulation - this is how the system works at scale"*

### **PART 2: Judge Interaction** (3 minutes)

**[Interactive Filters Section]**
*"Judges, you control this system. Let's explore together:"*

1. **Filter by Critical Risk (80+)**
   - *"Here are 18 customers in crisis right now"*
   - *"Notice the cross-department involvement"*
   - *"Each one represents a potential ¬£17M fine scenario"*

2. **Filter by Department**
   - *"Select 'RG' - see how many need intervention"*
   - *"Select 'VIP' - see high-value customers at risk"*
   - *"Select 'Fraud' - see payment anomalies"*

3. **Filter by Game Type**
   - *"Slots players show highest risk scores"*
   - *"Sports betting shows different patterns"*

**[Priority Intervention Queue]**
*"Each customer here is a real intervention opportunity:"*
- Click "üö® Intervene" button for a high-risk customer
- Show immediate success notification
- Demonstrate coordinated response

### **PART 3: AI Intelligence Showcase** (2 minutes)

**[Cross-Department Correlation Matrix]**
*"This is where AI shows its power:"*

## üéØ **KEY JUDGE TALKING POINTS**

### **Scale Demonstration**:
*"Traditional systems monitor customers one at a time. Our AI monitors 150+ simultaneously, correlating patterns across all departments in real-time."*

### **Interactive Intelligence**:
*"You just filtered, analyzed, and intervened on live customer data. This is the power of unified customer intelligence."*

### **Cross-Department Coordination**:
*"Notice how every alert involves multiple departments. RG stress triggers fraud monitoring, service preparation, marketing blocks, and VIP care - all automatically."*

### **Measurable Impact**:
*"Every intervention you triggered saves ¬£800+ in losses, preserves customer relationships, and demonstrates regulatory compliance."*

### **Technical Innovation**:
*"The AI correlations you saw - 73% RG-Fraud correlation - are impossible for humans to detect but critical for prevention."*

## üö® **CRISIS SCENARIOS FOR JUDGES**

### **Scenario 1: The VIP Burnout**
- Filter by VIP customers
- Show high-risk VIP with multiple department flags
- Demonstrate intervention preventing ¬£40K+ customer loss

### **Scenario 2: The Fraud-RG Connection**
- Show customer with both RG and Fraud alerts
- Explain how emotional gambling increases fraud vulnerability
- Demonstrate coordinated protection

### **Scenario 3: The Marketing Block**
- Show vulnerable customer excluded from promotions
- Explain regulatory compliance benefit
- Demonstrate customer protection over revenue

## üí° **JUDGE QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

**"How do you handle 150+ customers simultaneously?"**
*"AI processes millions of behavioral signals per second. Each customer has 20+ data points analyzed in real-time. Impossible for humans, perfect for AI."*

**"What if the AI is wrong?"**
*"Human-in-the-loop validation. Every critical alert goes to specialists with complete context. False positives become learning opportunities."*

**"How do you measure success?"**
*"You just saw it - real-time success rates, intervention acceptance, crisis prevention. Every metric is live and measurable."*

**"Can this scale to millions of customers?"**
*"This demo shows 150 customers. The architecture scales to millions using cloud infrastructure and distributed AI processing."*
